ANNOUNCEMENTS OF NEW BOOKS.

Agreeably to the first ol these principles, in the beginning the dis·
tinction between a body,a sursace, a line, anda point, is shown by
the use ol models, and later they are again employed to give clear
ideas respecting the regular solids. Many conceptions and simple
relations-such as occur, for instance, in the subject os parallels, ol
perpendiculars, of angles, os intersecting lines and planes, of equal
figures, of similar ligures, os polygons, etc-are illustrated by reser-
ence to well-known obJects3 and a variety os questions are asked,
which the learner can answer by reflecting upon what he has seen.

In proving theorems, in place os the formal method which begins
with a statement os the theorem and follows with the proos, unlolded
step by step in syllogistic reasoning, there is osten substituted the
method which begins with the study os a figure, and the relations of its
parts, and proceeds to the theorem‚ by the comparison and combina-
tion of ideas, much in the same way as the discoverer of the theorem
might have done. Care bas been taken to select theorems which are
simple, and which at the same time form a basis sor useful problems

' and applications.

Special stress has been laid upon the laws of the equality and ol
the similarity os triangles3 because, apart from their simple character,
they are the keys to nine-tenths at least ol the rest of Geometry, both
theoretical and practical.

Exercises are appended to almost every section, and to the end of
each chapter, and form one of the chief features of the book. They
are intended to throw the learner on his own resources, and to lead
him to invent and to generalize sor himself.

Among the applicationsv of Geometry which find a place in the
work, may be mentioned the testing of vertical and horizontal direc-
tions, drawing lines to scale, the construction os perpendicular lines
andos angles, the application os the laws of the equality and simi·
larity of triangles to the measurement os inaccessible distances, and a
great number and variety ol practical exercises upon the computation
os lengths, areas, and volumes.

The present work is adapted to ordinary pupils between the ages
ol twelve and sixteen. It forms a suitable introduction to higher
works on the same subject, and at the same time contains that part of
Geometry which every one, women not excepted, may study with in-
terest and with much intellectual profit. [Ready in June.
