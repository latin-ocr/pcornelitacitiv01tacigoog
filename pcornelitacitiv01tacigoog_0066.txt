Tlte Life os Agricola. ι 53

fifteenth century. As to the locality, it is plain from the expres·
sion praemissa classe, etc, that the scene ol the battle was near
the sea-shore. At any rate, itis far from likely that Agricola
reached a point so lar north as the Grampian Hills; and moreover
the battle would not receive its name from a great range of moun·
taius, but from some moderate hill which the enemy had invested‚
-quem hostis jam insederat.

10. pugnae prioris: im, of the former year3 Chap. XXVl.

15. cruda ao viridis senectus: this phrase is taken from Ver·
gil, AEn. vi. 304.

16. decora, badges os honor.

CHAPTER XXX.

21. animus,confidence.

23. nullae ultra terrae: i.e., sor refuge.

28. in nostris manibus: contrasted with those Britons by
whom in the previous battles certatum est.

29. eoque: this is the manuscript reading, which has been
altered into iique, on the ground that their nobility was no reason
lor their occupying the penetralia of Britain. But if we consider

. , nobilissimi to be used in its primitive sense, as relating to birth, we

shall see that· the puresl born, the autochthons,'would naturally be
in ipsis penetralibus siti
30. servientium: i.c., the Gauls, who were subject to Rome.
32· terrarum ao libertatis extremos: one ol Tacitus' nervous
expressions, - the remotest on tlte earth, and tlte last refuge affret-
’ dom. For the nationality of the Caledonians, see note on Chap. Xl.
33. sinus famae: this ligure is taken from the sium or pouch
made by asold in the toga, and is best explained as meaning the
obscurity of their same, recessus ae sinus may be regarded as a
kind of hendiadys,- the obscurity of fame resulting from distance.
34. Atque omne ignotum, etc.: as long as we were unknown,
we were dreaded. But now that we are reached, this dread can no
longer exist, forthere is no other nation beyond us, which can take
our place.

18. 3. defuere terrae: they have no more lands to conquer.

8. imperium is to be joined with appellant3 this sentence is a
powerful example of Tacitus* sententious eloquente, as indeed is the
whole speech of Calgacus»
