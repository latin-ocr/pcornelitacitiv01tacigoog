THE LETTERS OF THE YOUNGER PLINY.

Edited for Use in Schools and Colleges by Tmcr Puck, Professor
of Latin in Cornell University.

This edition will contain all the letters of Pliny, including the cor-
respondence with the Emperor Trajan, and a commentary upon the
entire series, The slight attention pald to these letters in our Latin
courses has often been remarked and regretted. The light which
they throw upon the public and private history of their time, the ami-
able and cultivated character of the writer, and their graceful style
and exquisite Larinity, make them exceptionally instructive and inter·

esting. [In preparation.

LATIN PRONUNCIATION

A Brief Outline of the Roman, Continenlal, and English Methods,
ο by D. B. KING, Adjunct Professor of Latin in Lafayette College.

Contains a few explanatory and historical paragraphs on the
Roman, Continental‚ and English methods of pronouncing Latin, aud
a brief presentalion of the main features of each, prepared for use at
Lafayette Collega, where the character and arrangement of studies in
English and Comparative Philology make it desirable that students
should have a knowledge of both Roman and English methods.

The students are carefully taught in practice to use the English
method, and to give the rules for the sound of the letters, this having
been found a valuable aid in teaching English Prouunciation and the
Philology of the English language. A knowledge of the Roman
method, giving the sounds, in the main, as we believe Cicero and
Virgil gave them, is required as a matter of historical informatiou and
culture, and as an important aid in determining the derivations of
words and laws of phonetic change, and iu illustrating the principles
of Comparative Philology. Mailiug price, 15 cents. [Ready.
