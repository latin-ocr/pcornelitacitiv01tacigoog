Tae Life of Agricola. 57

35. equitum turmae: turma is the term regularly used fora
division of Roman cavalry. It is used also, however, as a general
term for the cavalry of other nations, andis to be understood here
of the Caledonians. Agricola's cavalry, consisting of auxiliarios,
is spoken of in the next chapter as alae, the regular expression for

auxiliary cavalry.

22. 2. recentem terrorem, ete: the war-chariots at first
caused. some confusion among the assaulting party (the Romans),
but soon became useless on the hilly ground, and mixed in with the
thick ranks of their own countrymen3 hostium must, from Tacitus*
point of view, be the Caledoniam.-

4. minime equestris: the ground not being suited to horses,
this battle of the war-chariots, which would properly be ranked with
cavalry engagements‚ became minime equestris. The same ex·
pression‚ minime equestris more pugnae, is used by Livy (xxii.
47) with reference to the battle of Cannae, where, as here, the horse

. became useless from the closeness of the action and the nature of

the ground.

ς. aegre olivo astantes: the manuscripts read egradlu aut
stante; manifestly corrupt. Kritz reads ellvo instantes; Halm
and Draeger, adstantes. lt will be noted that in the round hand
of the manuscripts cliv could be easily mistaken for diu This ap·
pears to refer to the Caledonians3 while the following indicative
clause, ao saepe ...incursabant, describes both parties. ln this
difficult passage, Kritz (following Wex) reads aequa nostris for
equestres of the manuscripts, and instantes for aut stante,
making the confusion refer to the Romans. lt is evident‚ however,
from the following chapter, circumire terga vincentium, that the
Romans were successful so far, and were making their way trium-
phantly up the hill. The events of the battle had been as follows:
first, the skirmishing eminus; next, the assault made by the Bata·
vians and Tungrians; third, the joining of the war-chariots in the
battle. after the cavalry had been ronted (Interim . . . haerebant).
Then follows a description of the mixed nature of the battle (mini-
meque . . . impellerentur), and the confusion caused by the
frightened horses (ao saepe ...incursabanty

CHAPTER xxxvii.

9. qui adhuc: this clause is restrictiva-those Britons who,
etc.
