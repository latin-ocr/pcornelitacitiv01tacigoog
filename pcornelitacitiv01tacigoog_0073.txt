have not held the office or dignity itself. As, under the empire, the
honor osa triumph was restricted to the emperor, private citizens
could only have the ornamenta triumphalia; 'and of these the
most important-the laurei crown, the sceptre, the gilded throne
-were confined to the emperor. The ornamenta granted to
Agricola could, therefore. have been hardly more than the toga
praetexta. (Mommsen, Rimz'sclres Staotsreclrt, i.‚ p. 378.)

12. majoribus: Syria was an imperial province of the first rank,
governed by a legatus consularis, in this ranking with Britain and a
number of others, but it ranked as the most important province in
a military point of view, being on the frontier opposed to the great
rival empire of Parthia- Credidere plerique, it was generally
believed-libertum: freed slaves still continued in the service of
their former masters, and in close personal relation to them, like
that of client to patron. Emperors of the type of Nero and Domi-

as agents in all confidential affairs; and some of these freedmen
rose to great wealth and influence.

20. celebritate: this word does not seem to be used in its
primitive sense, which is nearly synonymous with frequentia, but

24. palatium: this word is in its origin only another form of
Palatinus, the hill of Rome upon which the earliest city was built.
This hill was selected by Augustus for his residence3 and his suc-
cessors built splendid houses upon it. The name then was gradu·
ally transferred from the hill to the edifice, in which sense it has
passed into the modern languages as palaea. The name Palatium
is derived from that of Palas, goddess of herds and flocks, upon
whose festival, the Palilra (April 21), common tradition placed the
founding of Rome. (Preller, llbrrzriclze Mytholagie, p 364.)
