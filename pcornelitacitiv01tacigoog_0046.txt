aediles, magistrates ol high rank; so, in modern times, buming by
the common hangman.

²3· in comitio ao toro. The comitium was the upper partos
the forum, towards the Capitoline mount: the words ln toro are
added to indicate the publicity oi the act.

2. 1. sapientiae, philosophy.-proiessorlbus, in the modern
meaning ol the word. The teachers of philosophy were banished
about mn. 94. -omnl bona arte: this relates to the same act, -
by the banishment oi the professors, every high aspiration in art
and science was driven into exile.

2. occurreret, used without an object, should meet one: almost
in the modern sense. occur. N otice that honestum qualifies quid
as an attribute, anything tlrat is honorablet quid . . ‚honesti would
mean, any vz'rtuc or honor.

5. inquisitiones. This refers to the trade of informer, or dela-
tor, which was at its height under Domitian. (See Merivale, His·
toryostlre Romans under tlte Empirc, Vol. vii, p. 1273 see also Vol.

8. nunc demum ric.. aiter the death ol Domitian, who was
assasslnated in September, 96.

9. saeculi. a cycle of years, originally identified with the long-
est age ol a man, which was reckoned to be 100 years (Mommsen,
Ronrt'sclra chronologia, p. 174). lt is used here in a more gen·
eral sense, age, and especially as the reign oi a given prince. - Nerva
Caesar. Nerva reigned from September, 96, to Jauuary, 983 the
use ol this expression shows that this work was composed in his
reign, for if he had died, he would have been called “Divus
Nerva.'' The same thing is shown by the use oi the perfect tense,
miscuerit.

ιο. miscuerit. Tacitus generally uses the subjunctive after
quamquam. -princlpatum, the office of prince or emperor, naon·
archy,· this mixture oi royalty and liberty makes a constitutional
monarchy.

12. Nerva Traianus. Trajan was adopted by Nerva, and asso·
ciated with him in the empire in September, 97, adding the name of
Nerva to his own. This expression, therefore, taken in connection
with Nerva Caesar above, shows that this work was written at some
time between September 18, 97, and January 27, 98.
