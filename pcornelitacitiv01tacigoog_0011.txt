one of his own household. No classical work is therefore bet·
η ter fitted to form part of a course which aims to contain only

1 what is intrinsically best and most characteristic. It is one of

those ionic writings which help to elevate and strengthen the
moral nature and build up character.

My aim, in the present edition, has been to meet the needs
of such a course. I have left special philological training to
the macher, only making occasional reference to the leading
grammars. On the other hand,I have undertaken to explain
the historical references with great fulness‚ and to give needful
assistance in all real difficulties. In the text Ι have for the
most part followed Kritz, but have not hesitated to vary from
it when there seemed to be good reason, especially in several
cases to restore the reading of the manuscripts. In preparing
the commentary‚ I have been chiefly assisted by Kritz, but have
, also made use of Driiger, Church and Brodribb‚ and Freund.
My special thanks are due to Prof. Tunes Paci< of Cornell

University, who has carefully read the whole proof‚ and whose

suggestions have frequently caused me to change or modify ,my ·
opinions.

It is my intention to follow this, as early as possible, with an
edition of the Germania of Tacitus.
