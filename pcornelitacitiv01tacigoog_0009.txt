iv ss Introduction.

the events of the years 68 and 69 in the Histories, appears to

be that of an eye-witness ; issu, we cannot ¹suppose him to ·
have been less than fifteen at that date. Another consideration
is that Tacitus was praetor ab. 88, which was the first year he
could have held that office, under the rules of the Republic, if
he had been bom in 51. These rules were, it is true, no longer
in force ; nevertheless, it is reasonable to suppose that they
still exerted some influence, and that this office would not be

held much before the traditional age. It may be added that ' ,

Pliny was probably not far from fifty-five when he made use of
the expression propemodum aequalem· and that this term might
apply very well to two men of fifty-five and sixty-three or live.
He probably died about nn. 116.

Of the events of his life very little is known. He married the
daughter of Agricola in the year An). 78 (Chap. IX.), and it
has been conjectured that he was a member of his military

family during his administration of Aquitania the three previous . ¹

years, He was praetor an. 88, and was afterwards absent from
Rome for four years, during which period his father-in-law died,
nn. 93 (Chap. XLV.). He was consul under Nerva, an. 97.
We leam from several passages in Pliny that he was a distin·
guished lawyer and orator, as well as historian.

lt is almost by accident that we possess the writings of Taci-
tuS, for the manuscripts in which they have come down to us
are very few, and badly mutilated. These writings are: 1. The
Dialogue os Orators (De Oratoribus), an early composition, so
different in style from his later works that many have thought
it could not have been written by him. .2. Ite Lffe os Agri-
cola. 3. Germany: a description of the nations of Gennany,
which forms our best source of information as to their early
condition. It is about as large awork as the Agricola. 4. Tlre
Jn‘stoitesjin fourteen books: a detailed narration of events
