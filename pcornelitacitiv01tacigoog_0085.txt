A GERMAN GRAMMAR FOR SCHOOLS AND COL-
LEGES,byW1ur„1nn Coore and E. S. Snusnou of Harvard college.

This Grammar is intended to he simple enough for boys and girls
who have never studied any other language than their own, but it will,
at the same time, coll attention to kindred usages in French and the
classical languages,—with which college students have already some
familiarity,-and thus render the acquisition of German easier to
these latter. It is intended to be the first and the last grammar in the

· student's hands-not only to teach him the first elements of the lan-
guage, hut to serve continually afterwards as a work of reference while
reading or writing German.

It will aim, in the first place, at greater clearness, and then at
greater completeness, than the grammars now generally studied. Suit·
able use will be made of Lehmann's works on the language of Lessing,

, Goethe‚ etc, of the articles on grammatical points in the Archiv fu'r

⁴ das Studium der neueren Sprachen, of the authors’ memoranda made

while reading many different German books with college classes, and

of the dictionaries- especially the Dictionary of the Main Difficulties

of the German Language-of the authors’ valued correspondent,
Professor Daniel Sanders.

The alphabetical index will be made up by the authors themselves,
and contain, it is hoped, every single topic in the text. Should space
allow, exercises on the plau of Heyse's, consisting, that is, of German
sentences containing graminatical morales, will be introduced into
the body of the text. The Prehxes and Suffixes, the Particles, the
Modal Auxiliaries, and the order of the different elements of the
Sentence, will be treated with especial care. On these and other sub·
jects of more than usual difficulty or importance to the average student,
the authors invite suggestions. [In prqtaration.
