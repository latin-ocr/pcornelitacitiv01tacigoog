About seventy easy and well-graded lessons‚ both Greek and Eng-
lish, introduce the pupil to the first book of Xenophon’s Anabasis
from which the Exercises and Vocabularies are mainly selected.
Definite directions have been given in regard to tbe amount of the
Grammar to be learned. ‘l'he main aim has been, while introducing
the simplet principles of syntax, to have the pupil master the [ψι-
tiens and acquire a Vocabulary. ln furtherance of this purpose, the ·
exercises on the inflections have been increased, while those on syntax · ¹
have been decreased. Vocabularies have been given under ead
lesson; and, in order to aid the pupil in memorizing them, some
insight has been given into the derivation and into the composition of
words,-how they are built up, by means of significance endings‚ from Ι ι
noun and verb stemS, and from roots. The Prepesitions ure introduced
from the first ; and the pupil is taught the primary meanings, and then
how these meanings are modified by the cases before which the Prep-
ositions stand. Questions for Review and Examination asin the first “
edition. In rewriting these Lessons, considerable use has been made
of the excellent exercises, used in most of the German gymnasiums, Ι

prepared by Dr. Wasener to accompany the Greek Grammar of Pro·
sessor Curtius. ’ [Ready in June. Ι “
