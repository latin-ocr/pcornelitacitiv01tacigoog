A GE OMETRY FOR BE GINNERS.

Adapted to Lower and Grammar School Work. By G. A. Hnr,
Harvard University. .

The principles which underlie the metbod employed in this work
are the following :—

1. Geometrical instruction for beginners should proeeed from the
concrete to the abstract. ⁸

2. It should aim to develop the geometric imagination and the
inventive faculty, by making reasonable demands upon the mental
powers of the learner.

3. It should be practical,- that isto say, it should seize every
fitting opportunity to illustrate and explain the uses of Geometry.
