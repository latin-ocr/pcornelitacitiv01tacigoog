The Life of Agricola.

CHAPTER XLI.

35. laudantes, not laudatores, which would mean a person
who made this a practice3 the participle is strictly temporary,-
those who praese one. This praise is sometimes understood as
ironical‚ of secret enemies3 . it is better t'o understand it of the
inopportune, although sincere, praise of injudicious friends; see
opttmus qulsqus libertorum below.

25. ς. llmtte: 'this word properly means a path left as a
boundary between two estates3 from this there is a natural transition
to a boundary line. Under the emplre it is used for a fortified
frondem-ripa: no doubt from what goes before, the banks of
both Rhine and Danube were meant; the special reference is, how-
ever. to the Danube, where the Goths invaded the Roman provinces.

6. possessione, sc. provinciarum- demnis, dative.

7. omnis annus, the whole year.

12. opttmus quisque: these were the laudantes referred to
above.

14. deterioribus, neuter.

16. praeceps agebatur: i.e., to a glory which was his tuin.

17. proconsulatum Asiae et Africae. In his previous com-
mands, Aquitania and Britannia, Agricola had acted simply as
legatus or deputy of the emperor, in administering provinces of
which the emperor himself was in theory governor3 it was now his
time to become himself the governor, proconsul, ofa senatorial
province (see note, Chap. VII.). This office, in which the gov· ·
emor had, in theory, independent power, was superior in dignity to
that of the imperial provinces, in which the governor was onlya
deputy; but it was inferior in effective power, because he exer·
cised only civil authority. lt was bestowed, as in the republic, on
men who had held magistracies3 Asia and Africa alone to those
who had been consuls; the other nine to past praetors. But, wher'eas
in the Republic they were given to the magistrates immediately upon
leaving their office, under the empire there must be an interval of
some years-at this period generally thirteen years (Marquardt,
RaimrsckeStaatsverwaltung, i.‚ p. 40 ς.) The office was held for only
a year at a time. (Mommsen, Ro'misclus Staatsrecht, i, p. 234.)
